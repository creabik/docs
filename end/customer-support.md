# Customer Support

Please remember you have purchased a very affordable theme and you did not pay for a full-time web design agency. We will help with your issues, but these requests will be put on a relevant priority, regarding their nature. Support is provided for your comfort and for a best possible experience, so please be patient, polite and respectful, as we are towards you.

## **Support includes:**

{% hint style="success" %}
* • Responding to questions or problems regarding the item and its features
* • Fixing bugs and reported issues
* • Providing updates
{% endhint %}

## **Support doesn't include :**

{% hint style="danger" %}
* • Customization and installation services
* • Support for third party software and plugins
{% endhint %}

##  **Before Support:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* • Make sure your question is a valid Theme Issue and not a customization request
* • Make sure you have read through the documentation and any ressources before asking support on how to accomplish a task
* • If you have customized your theme and now have an issue, back-track to make sure you didn't make a mistake. If you have made changes and can't find the issue, please provide us with your changelog.
* • Almost 80% of the time we find that the solution to people's issues can be solved with a simple "Google Search". You might want to try that before seeking support. You might be able to fix the issue yourself much quicker than we can respond to your request.
* • Make sure to state the name of the theme you are having issues with when requesting support.
