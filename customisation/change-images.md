# Change Images:



Addkit template downloaded package does not contain images that are there in our online demo. We are using placeholder images instead of real images. You will see the image code as mentioned below. You can replace placeholder image URL with your image URL like:

{% hint style="success" %}
`./assets/img/Image_URL.png`
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="images Structure" %}
```text
| --- img
| --- |---- bg
| --- |---- decoratios
| --- |---- elements
| --- |---- icons
| --- |---- illustration
| --- |---- logo
| --- |----- ...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
